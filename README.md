# ParkingLotSystem
Project Designed for my final project regarding National Dilploma.
It still has some room for improvements, especially in the way that the administrator makes the searches for the information
on the database. There are simple things that were not finished due to time, but I am still working on it. Even thought is an unfinished
project, I still am proud of it, because I learnt a lot when it comes down to hardware and software communication and also the interaction between Server and Client using normal sockets. 
In this project, There was a serial communication between Java application and Arduino. And there's an interaction between Server and Client using normal socket connection.

Because the File exceeds 25Mb, It was not possible to upload the Project. Therefore, I uploaded the documentation and some images, just to have an idea on how the project worked theoretically and how the project looks. For more information Regarding the project, please read the Documentation attached on the Report folder.
