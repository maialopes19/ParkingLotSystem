# ParkingLotSystem
Project Design for my final project regarding National Dilploma.
This Project, still has some room for improvements, especially in the way that the administrator makes the searches for the information
on the database. There are simple things that were not finished due to time, but I am still working on it. Even thought is an unfinished
project, I still am proud of it, because I learnt a lot when in comes down to hardware and software comunication. 
In this project, There was a serial communication between Java application and Arduino.

Because the File exceeds 25Mb, It was not possible to upload the Project. Therefore, I uploaded the documentation and some images in just to check how the project looks.
